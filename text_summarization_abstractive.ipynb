appropriate restrictions over it has also increased significantly. people of all ages whether children or elderly people all have the same access to social media sites and micro- blogging sites thus there is a necessity to filter out the comments appropriately. thus, we are developing a machine learning based model for classifying that if comments done on twitter are abusive or not. for this we have used various machine learning models and have procured an f1- score of accuracy of 97.58% using logistic regression, 97.66% using svm and 97.64% using voting classifier that is an amalgamation of logistic regression and svm.', '', 'introduction:', '\\twith the increase in the use of social media sites like facebook, instagram and micro-blogging sites like twitter people are now have more ways to express their views and ideas and have encouraged mass communication significantly. but not all users use the technology in an appropriate ways and use it to express their anger using abusive and derogatory comments. thus, there should be a mechanism using which we can detect such comments and filter out the abusive comments. thus, we have proposed a machine learning based model that detects if a comment done is abusive or not. in our work, we have used different machine learning models in order to obtain the model which can determine the comments as abusive and non-abusive efficiently. for this we have used “hate speech and offensive language dataset” [ 1] consisting of 24,782 samples and 7 features out of which we have extracted features relevant to our work and had modified the labels as per the requirement. this dataset consists of comments obtained from twitter data and is used to classify the data as hate-speech, offensive and neither. we have modified this dataset as the comments having offensive and non-offensive language and have removed the samples that were hate-speeches.', '', 'literature survey:', '\\tdetermining if a comment on a post is abusive or not is very tedious and difficult tasks and many of the social media sites and platforms are still working to get more accurate and efficient ways to handle such comments. a lot of work is being conducted in this area. mukul anand[2] et.al in his paper has used deep learning based model and classified the comments in various categories namely, severe threat, toxic, obscene, insult and identity hate with the help of techniques like cnn, lstm, etc. ji ho park[3] et al. in their paper has implemented a two- step approach of classification of abusive comments and their classification and has compared it using the traditional single step approach using english twitter corpus. the detection of comments is not confined to english only and has been done using other languages also like, muhammad pervez akhter[4] et al. in his paper titled “abusive language detection from social media comments using conventional machine learning and deep learning approaches” have used deep learning based models like cnn, lstm, blstm and clstm for detecting abusive comments in urdu and roman urdu languages. similarly, tanjim taharat aurpa[5] et al. in their paper has proposed an approach to classify the comments in bengali as an abusive. m. anand[6] et al. has used feature selection techniques and multilingual offensive language detection using deep learning techniques to classify the language as offensive or not after removing noise, stopwords, from them and performing filtering and segmentation. for feature selection they have fuzzy based cnn. monirul islam pavel in his work have implemented a cnn and nlp based ensemble method for that performs segmentation on non-toxic and toxic comments in the first phase and then classify them into 6 types, for the preprocessing part they have performed using

not of use for our work. then we have labelled our data based on the comment if it is abusive or not. further we have applied nlp techniques for the preprocessing of the dataset. after that the data has been split into the training and testing dataset for cross validation and the training dataset have been trained on various models mentioned above.  then the testing dataset has been passed to the trained model and the model predicts the output for the testing data along with the evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and confusion matrix and classification report. after the cross-validation the overall model has been trained on voting classifier and the unknown testing data has been taken in real time from the twitter using its api and after the preprocessing of the

less time and is very good for the classification tasks. the text data can have noise present in it.', 'random forest', 'to overcome this problem, we have used random forest as it is one of the most
